## Adding Code to Markdown

You can add inline `code` using a single backtick. Or a block of code using thee backticks:

```
# This is a Level One Header
## This is a Level Two Header
```

You can specify the language in a block of code after the three ticks:

```markdown
# This is a Level One Header
## This is a Level Two Header
```

Here is some sample JavaScript:

```javascript
document.write("Hello World!");
```

## Tables

To add tables to a Markdown documnet you use a series of dashes and bars:

| Heading 1      | Heading 2     | Heading 3     |
| -------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Value 1        | Value 2       | Value 3       |

Tables in your Markdown file don't need to line up:

Heading 1 | Heading 2 | Heading 3
--- | --- | ---
Value 1 | Value 2 | Value 3

## Lists

You can add lists using number `<ol>` or dashes `<ul>`:

1. This is the first list item.
2. This is the second list item.

    This is the second paragraph in the second list item.

3. This is the third list item.
